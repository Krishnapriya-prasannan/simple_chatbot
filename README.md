#  Day 1 - Rule-Based AI Chatbot with NLTK

This project is part of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge. On **Day 1**, I built a simple **rule-based chatbot** in Python using **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** to process user input.

##  Project Goal

- Understand the basics of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- Explore **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using the NLTK library
- Build an interactive, rule-based chatbot that responds based on user input
- Learn how tokenization works using the `punkt` tokenizer model

##  Technologies Used

| Tool      | Purpose                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| Python    | Main programming language            |
| NLTK      | Natural Language Toolkit for NLP     |
| Punkt     | Pre-trained tokenizer for NLTK       |
| VS Code   | Code editor                          |

##  How It Works

1. The chatbot takes user input from the terminal.
2. It uses **NLTK's `word_tokenize()`** to break the input into individual words (tokens).
3. Based on the presence of keywords, the chatbot responds using **simple if-else logic**.
